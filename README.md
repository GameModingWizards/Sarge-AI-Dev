Sarge AI System

This is an AI system that is intended to simulate real players roaming the map, scavenging, looting and engaging in combat. Unlike other AI systems Sarge AI designates two factions as friendly and only one faction as hostile. This approach provides a simulated pvp/pve environment that changes depending on how players react to the AI. If a player fires and hits a friendly unit the entire group will become hostile and return fire. AI groups will perceive a player that has fired and hit one of it's members as hostile until the group is dead or the player is dead. AI are configured to treat any player with a specific amount of respect one of two ways. If the player has respect below the threshold they will be considered hostile and treated as an enemy by all AI. If the player has respect above the threshold they will be considered friendly only by the friendly factions of AI. If a player shoots or kills any AI the player's respect will be changed in one of two ways. If the AI target is from a friendly faction the player will lose respect for each shot and kill. If the AI target is from a hostile faction the player will be rewarded respect for each shot and kill.

As you can see already these AI are very capable of roaming around the areas they spawn in and defending themselves when neccessary. This version of Sarge AI is designed to work with the Arma 3 Exile mod but can be modified to work with any environment. With that said, there are three (3) factions of AI within this feature:

    The Survivors
        Fighting for survival as most of us are; These AI do not wish to start unneccessary confilict as they intend on living as much as any player. These AI will assume every player is friendly unless they are given reason to think otherwise. They often wear toned down military apparel and civilian clothing and should be easy to spot as to not frighten unaware players.

    The Military
        As the dominant force in a wasteland of fugitives and other life threatening obstacles the military takes no chance when it comes to combat. Dressed in high level miliatry apparel and the weapons to back it up these NPCs will roam about the area they spawn in and nuetralize any threat they encounter. Dont' be a threat ;)

    The Bandits
        With no apparent loyalty to anyone but the small group of others they travel with these NPCs will roam the map surviving any way they are able to. These AI will steal any loot they encounter and attempt to kill any player they encounter. Outfitted with respectable weapons and headwraps to protect their identities from the authorities these AI make for a formibale enemy.

This description is brief but to the point. Although it may not be listed you will find these NPCs are capable of suprising things.
